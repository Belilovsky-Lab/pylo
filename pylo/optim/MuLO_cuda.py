"""MuLO_CUDA: An Cuda-accelerated MLP learned optimizer in μP.

This is a PyTorch implementation of μLO from: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00153

    CUDA-accelerated μP (Maximal Update Parameterization) wrapper for the Adafac learned optimizer.
    
    This function applies the μP parameterization to the CUDA version of the Adafac learned
    optimizer, providing GPU acceleration for faster training. It organizes parameters into
    groups based on their infinite-width shape properties and scales learning rates according
    to width multipliers for matrix-like parameters.
        
    Note:
        This implementation requires that all parameters have been processed with
        mup.set_base_shapes() to establish their infinite-width behavior. The CUDA
        implementation provides significant performance improvements over the naive
        version for large models.
        
    Example:
        >>> model = MyModel().cuda()  # Move model to GPU
        >>> mup.set_base_shapes(model, base_model)
        >>> optimizer = MuLO_CUDA(model.parameters())
